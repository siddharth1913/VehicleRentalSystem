Vehicle Rental System
A robust console-based application for managing vehicle rentals.

About The Project
This project is a foundational C# console application that serves as a proof of concept for a complete vehicle rental system. It demonstrates a strong grasp of modern software design principles and patterns. The application allows users to register customers, add vehicles (cars and bikes), and manage the booking and return process in a straightforward, command-line interface.

Technical Highlights
The system's architecture is a key feature, designed for scalability and maintainability.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The application is built around a clear object model with distinct classes for Customer, Vehicle, Car, and Bike, demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism.

SOLID Principles: Adheres to SOLID principles, with a strong emphasis on the Single Responsibility Principle and Dependency Inversion. Core functionalities like booking and returns are implemented through dedicated services and interfaces (IBookable, IReturnable).

Dependency Injection (DI): Services are injected into other classes, decoupling components and making the system highly testable and extensible.

Features
ðŸ‘¤ Customer Management: Register and view a list of all customers.

ðŸš— Vehicle Management: Add new vehicles and display available or booked vehicles.

ðŸ“… Booking & Returns: Seamlessly book a vehicle for a specified number of days and manage its return.

ðŸ’° Dynamic Pricing: Calculates the total rental cost based on the vehicle type and duration.
